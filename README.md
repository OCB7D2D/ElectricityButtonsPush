# OCB Electricity Push Button Circuits - 7 Days to Die (DMT/Hamrony) Addon

This (Harmony) Mod adds a new block that support push button
circuits (those you often find in hallways or in staircases).
Each button in line basically actuates the root button when
pushed. These work similar like regular trigger groups, but
only the root item is actually actuated. These also contribute
to regular trigger groups. You can mix these with other triggers.
Use power relays to break into multiple independent groups.

There is a special mode if you set the power duration to always.
In this mode every push on any button will toggle the root.
This way you can turn lights on and off at any button.
